Queues in Java Context
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added is the first to be removed. Java provides several implementations of queues, including Queue, Deque, PriorityQueue, and array-based queues. Additionally, a stack operates on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

1. General Queue (FIFO)
Definition: Represents a queue where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
Key Interface: Queue (part of java.util package).
Common Implementations: LinkedList, PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque.

2. Deque (Double-Ended Queue)
Definition: A queue where elements can be added or removed from both ends.
Key Interface: Deque (extends Queue).
Common Implementations: ArrayDeque, LinkedList.

3. Priority Queue
Definition: A queue where elements are dequeued based on their priority, not their insertion order.
Key Class: PriorityQueue (implements Queue).
Behavior: Elements are ordered according to their natural order or a custom comparator.

4. Stack (LIFO)
Definition: A collection that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
Key Class: Stack (part of java.util package).

5. Array-Based Queue
Definition: A queue implemented using an array.
Implementation:
Use an array to store elements.
Maintain pointers for the front and rear of the queue.
Ensure circular behavior for efficient use of space.

Type	Principle	Use Case

Queue, FIFO,	Task scheduling, messaging queues

Deque,	Both ends,	Double-ended, operations

PriorityQueue,	Priority-based,	Priority task management

Stack	LIFO,	Backtracking, undo operations

Array-Based Queue,	FIFO (Array)	Simple, space-efficient queues

These queue types are suited for different use cases in Java programming.
