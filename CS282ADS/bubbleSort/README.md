Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues until no swaps are needed, meaning the list is sorted.

How It Works
Compare adjacent elements.
Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
Repeat for all elements until the list is sorted.

Bubble Sort has a time complexity of:
Best case: O(n) (already sorted array).
Worst/average case: O(nÂ²) (unsorted array).
It's not efficient for large datasets but is easy to implement and understand.
