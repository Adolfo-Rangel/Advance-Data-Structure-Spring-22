Polymorphism in Java is an object-oriented programming concept where a single entity (method, object, or interface) behaves differently in different contexts. It allows the same method or object to perform different tasks depending on the situation.

Types of Polymorphism
Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):

Happens when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
The method to call is determined at compile time based on the method signature.

Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding):

Happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.
The method to call is determined at runtime based on the object type.

Key Points
Method Overloading:
Achieves polymorphism at compile time.
Methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class.
Method Overriding:
Achieves polymorphism at runtime.
Subclass modifies the behavior of a parent class method.
Dynamic Binding:
In runtime polymorphism, the method call is resolved dynamically at runtime.

Benefits of Polymorphism
Code Reusability:
Write more generic and reusable code.
Flexibility:
Use a parent class reference for multiple child class objects.
Extensibility:
Easy to extend and modify behavior without changing existing code.
In short, polymorphism makes Java programs more flexible and maintainable by enabling a single interface to support multiple implementations.
