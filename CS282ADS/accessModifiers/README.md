In Java, access modifiers are keywords that define the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. They control where these can be accessed from:

public: Accessible from anywhere in the program.
protected: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
default (no keyword): Accessible only within the same package.
private: Accessible only within the same class.
These modifiers help enforce encapsulation and control access to your code
