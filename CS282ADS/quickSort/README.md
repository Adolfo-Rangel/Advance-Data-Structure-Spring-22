QuickSort in Java is a highly efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a "pivot" element and partitioning the array such that:

1. Elements smaller than the pivot go to its left.
   
2. Elements larger than the pivot go to its right.
   
This process is repeated recursively for the left and right subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

Steps of QuickSort
Choose a Pivot:

Typically the first, last, or middle element, or a random element.
Partition the Array:

Rearrange elements around the pivot such that smaller elements are to its left and larger elements are to its right.
Recursively Apply QuickSort:

Perform the same steps for the left and right subarrays.

Key Points
Time Complexity:

Best case: 
O(nlogn) (balanced partitions).
Worst case: 
O(n^2) (unbalanced partitions, e.g., already sorted array without random pivot).
Average case: 
O(nlogn). Space Complexity:

In-place sorting, requiring 

O(logn) space for recursive calls.

Advantages:

Faster than many other algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort for large datasets.
Works well for in-place sorting.

Disadvantages:

Performance depends on pivot selection.
Recursive, which may lead to stack overflow for large arrays.
QuickSort is widely used due to its efficiency and simplicity in handling large datasets.
