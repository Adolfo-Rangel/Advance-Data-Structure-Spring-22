In Java, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP).

Class
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
It defines the properties (fields/attributes) and behaviors (methods/functions) that the objects will have.

Object
An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the new keyword.
An object represents a specific entity with its own values for the fields defined in the class.

Key Points
Class:
Defines the structure and behavior of objects.
Serves as a blueprint.
Object:
A specific instance of a class.
Contains unique values for the class's properties.
In summary, a class is the definition, while an object is the realization of that definition.
