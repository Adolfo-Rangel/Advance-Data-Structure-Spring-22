Why Use Encapsulation?
Protect Data: Ensures fields are not directly accessible, reducing the risk of invalid data.
Control Changes: Makes it easier to validate or transform data before setting it.
Flexibility: Internal implementation can change without affecting external code.
Reusability: Encapsulated code can be reused across different parts of the application.
In short, encapsulation ensures a class has full control over its data and behavior while protecting its integrity from external interference.
