In Java, the File class is part of the java.io package and is used to represent file and directory pathnames. It provides methods for creating, deleting, and accessing file and directory information, but it does not read or write file content directly.

To read file content in Java, you often use classes like FileReader, BufferedReader, or Scanner, along with the File class.

What is the File Class?
Purpose: Represents the file or directory and provides basic operations on them.
Key Operations:
Check if a file exists.
Create or delete files and directories.
Retrieve file properties like size, path, or name.

How to Read Files Using FileReader and BufferedReader
To read the contents of a file, the File class is typically combined with FileReader and BufferedReader:

FileReader:
Reads character streams from a file.
BufferedReader:
Wraps a Reader (like FileReader) and provides efficient line-by-line reading.
Example: Reading a File with FileReader and BufferedReader

Alternative: Using Scanner to Read Files
The Scanner class can also be used to read a file, typically when processing input line by line or token by token.

Summary
File Class: Represents the file or directory but does not directly read/write content.
FileReader and BufferedReader: Used to read file content, often for text files.
Scanner: Reads file content and processes input more flexibly.
Choose the reader class based on the task. For simple text processing, Scanner is easier; for efficient reading of large files, use BufferedReader.
