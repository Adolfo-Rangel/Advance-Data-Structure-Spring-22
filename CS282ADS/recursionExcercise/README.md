This type of assignment is typically called a recursive programming exercise. It's meant to test your understanding of:

Recursion: Breaking down a problem into smaller, similar sub-problems.
Base Case: Preventing infinite recursion by stopping when a specific condition is met (n == 1 here).
Mathematical Thinking: Translating a recursive formula into code.

 It teaches:

How to implement recursion.
How to trace and debug recursive calls.
The importance of a base case to terminate recursion
