In Java, Pascal's Triangle is a triangular arrangement of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. It is often used in combinatorics, binomial expansions, and probability.

Structure of Pascal's Triangle
The first row is always 1.
Each number in the triangle (except the edges) is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Key Formula
The value at position (row, col) in Pascal’s Triangle can be represented as:

𝐶(𝑟𝑜𝑤,𝑐𝑜𝑙) = ((𝑟𝑜w!) / (𝑐𝑜𝑙!⋅(𝑟𝑜𝑤−𝑐𝑜𝑙)!)
​
 
Where C(row, col) is the binomial coefficient.

How It Works
Outer Loop:
Iterates through the rows of the triangle.
Inner Loops:
First inner loop handles formatting with spaces.
Second inner loop calculates and prints numbers in each row.
Computation:number = previous number × (row - column) / column + 1
​



Each number is calculated using the formula

Applications of Pascal's Triangle
Binomial Expansion: Coefficients for expanding expressions like 
(x+y) n
Combinatorics: Calculating combinations (
(nCk).
Probability: Modeling certain probabilities.
This simple Java program is a classic example to understand loops, nested structures, and mathematical computations.
